# contractile-vacuole-pressure
Code associated with the paper by Velle et al. **"A conserved pressure-driven mechanism for regulating cytosolic osmolarity"**

This includes code for tracking the orientation of the contractile vacuole relative to the direction of cell movement 
[cv_orientation](cv_orientation) as well as code associated with the simulations of different mechanisms of CV pumping.
